His aim was to create a content, that would fit what he called \"alpha geeks\": technologists and IT professionals. Terrence's vision was to lead a news outlet with a simple editorial mission: be \"technically savvy, up-to-date, and more fun\" than what was dominating the industry back then. In following years, with noticeable contributions by our knowledgeable editorial staff, Gadnews became a number 1 source for gadget news, tech specs reviews and analysis\u044e  As well as for breakdowns of the latest scientific advancements, software and hardware articles, and nearly everything else in between.\r\n \r\nGadnews excels it's content quality by listening to its core readership. Readers have demanded relevant, fun and informative news from us - which we've been successfully delivering for all these years. The result is something outstanding in it's niche. An unparalleled marriage of expertise and fun in IT journalism.\r\n \r\nSpecifically thanks to devoted readers, Gadnews also accomplished a number of industry leading achievements. In 2001, Gadnews launched a pay-per-article service, when such things were non-existent for digital media. Gadnews was also the first IT platform to begin covering the resurgence of Apple, and the first to draw analytical and cultural ties between the world of high technology and gaming.\r\n \r\nIn May 2015, Gadnews expanded overseas - to the UK, establishing an office in the heart of London. The new website, demolink.org, and its dedicated editorial team, will focus on stories from the UK and Europe, consolidating Gadnews's global remit of influential, impartial coverage of all things technology.","filter":true}},"cherry-sidebar-manager-1":{"nav_menu-14":{"nav_menu":39},"gadnews_widget_subscribe_follow-5":{"enable_subscribe":{"enable_subscribe":"true"},"subscribe_title":"Know Everything About New Gadgets!","subscribe_message":"Sign up for our newsletter and read latest gadgets reviews and tech news!","subscribe_input":"Enter your email","subscribe_submit":"icon:envelope-o","subscribe_success":"You successfully subscribed","enable_follow":{"enable_follow":"true"},"follow_title":"Gadnews on Social Networks","follow_message":""},"widget-custom-postson-8":{"title":"Recent posts","terms_type":"category_name","posts_per_page":"2","post_offset":"0","title_length":"10","excerpt_length":"10","mate_data":{"date":"true","author":"false","comment_count":"false","category":"false","post_tag":"false","more_button":"false"},"button_text":"Read More","category_name":["apple"]}}}
